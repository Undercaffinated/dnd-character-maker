In no particular order:


- When the roll button in Step 2.1 is clicked, the numbers generated should
auto-populate the stat dropdowns in Step 2.1


- Change the names of steps from #.# to #.{a-z}

- Step 2.1: Write a js function that can calculate based on some Ability Score
array the correct number of Point Buy Points remain.
    - Implement this solution so that it updates the textContent of
    "Point-Buy-Points-Remaining" element in step 2.1


- Starts a documentation page. Outline the logic on this thing.


- Step 2b:
    - Find a place to store each race's racial bonuses. Perhaps an array of js
    objects?

    - Design a js func that takes in a character level and class and outputs
    the number of bonus points they should be able to add to their character's
    stats and how many feats they can afford.

    - Design a function that takes in the total number of bonus points a player
    should be able to allocate to stats and the number of feats they  have
    taken, and return both the number of bonus points they can still allocate
    and/or the number of feats they can take.
